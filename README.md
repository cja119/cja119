Hello, my name is Cameron and I am a PhD student in Operations Research at Imperial College London's Sargent Centre for Process System Engineering. My primary research interest is in optimisation under uncertainty, with my doctoral thesis underpinned by an application in the hydrogen economy. My research aims to understand and quantify the influence of uncertainty on the development of the hydrogen economy and how, if left unmitigatted, the detrimental impact of this uncertainty on the potential of the economy. I am supervised by Professors Nilay Shah, Adam Hawkes and Dr Chris Tighe.
